Unit tests are used to ensure that code works as intended. Code coverage is usually used as a tool to indicate how "good" your tests are. However, even 100% code unit test coverage does not sufficiently ensure the code is robust to current errors due to user inputs, or future errors due to changes in the source code. It’s easy to see how code coverage falls short:

A function that gives a boolean if a number is greater than 10:
```r
greater_than_ten <- function(x) {
  x > 10
}
```

A unit test for the `greater_than_ten()` function:

```r
testthat::test_that(“greater_than_10 works as expected”, {
  expect_true(greater_than_ten(11))
  expect_false(greater_than_ten(9))
})
```

Code coverage would be 100%, but by looking at the code there’s clear cases where the above unit tests would not be sufficient. For example, what if a user passes a type that is a not a number? Booleans can be passed in and will be treated as 0 (`FALSE`) or 1 (`TRUE`), but it would make more sense to throw an error instead most likely.

Whereas unit testing checks that a module's code works as expected, mutation testing does the same for those unit tests. Mutation testing was first proposed by Richard Lipton in 1971, and first implemented in 1980. However, due to the computationally intensive nature of mutation testing, the technique wasn’t used more widely until computer power improved. In mutation testing, the code is broken down to an abstract syntax tree (AST), then a “mutant” is created by changing a single operator (e.g., swap a boolean). The idea is that the unit tests should now fail against the mutant; if a test fails then the mutant is said to be “killed”. When unit tests do not fail against a mutant the mutant has “survived” and indicates a problem.

The main goal of mutation testing is to improve unit tests. It does this by exposing flaws in current tests, as well as suggesting new tests through surviving mutants (source code changes that unit tests do not catch).

Mutation testing entails a fair amount of challenges and complexity. First, there’s the limitations of R. In the R programming language we do not have an easy way to create and work with an AST of an R script or package. There are some R tools (e.g., some functions in rlang) but nothing that allows easy modification and re-creation of code from an R file. In Python or Ruby, for two examples, there’s easy to use tools to break down a script into an AST, modify that AST, and rewrite to disk (Python docs, see refs).

Second, mutation testing can be time consuming. For example, if one run of unit tests for a package takes one minute, then for a mutation testing run we’d multiply one minute by dozens or hundreds of runs, one for each mutant. Of course this can be sped up by parallelizing, among other tricks. For large packages, running mutation testing on a cloud hosted CI will be the easiest solution.

Implementing queues for running all mutants that work across operating systems, and with good failure behavior, will potentially be challenging, but very much solvable. MORE EXPLANATION
