### Major pieces to complete

- Creating mutations: First, finish implementing abstract syntax tree (AST) tooling (astr package). Second, finish implementing the use of astr in a comprehensive set of tools in mutant for creating mutations.
- Implement a queueing system to be able to spin up R sessions across platforms, and then collect results from each session.
- Functions for reporting to the user results of test runs. Leveraging cli/symbols packages to create easy to interpret results
- Documentation

(Use a schematic of the workflow within the package?)
